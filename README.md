## General Information
> This is a beginner level project to teach you:
- Clean Architecture
- ASP.NET Core Web Api
- .NET Core Library
- Angular


## Technologies Used
- .NET Core - version 6
- Angular - version 13
- EF Core - version 6



## Features
- CRUD Operation


## What do you learn in this project?
- How to design a multi layers project with clean architecture
- Build web api application with ASP.NET Core 6
- Build the web application UI base on Angular 13 
- Connect the UI to Backend With Angular + TypeScript 
- How to use RadiButton, Checkbox, DropDown, Input and feed them by api in Angular

## What does this application do?
this is a simple singel page application that contains a table and a form. the form has multi type of html inputs and allow you register the person data into database or edit previous data. by the table you can see data or delete them.

## Create Projects
At the first step we Create a blank solution in visual studio the add the projects as follow:
> a class library with the name *Domain* for our models, dto, ...

> a class library with the name *Infrastructure* for interfaces such as unitofwork and other common general operations that are gonna use in other layers

> a class library with the name *DAL* to communicate with database

> a class library with the name *IoC* to handle our dependency injections in one layer

> a class library with the name *BL* to implement our business roles 

> a web api .net core to implement our apis

## Develop Domain Layer
This is our data diagram:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30793006/182148220-c85e0e71-6a47-4ad0-937d-7be609547f6b.png)
We have 3 tables:
> *Person* is the table that keeps person data.

> *Personality* is the table that keeps the personalities types.(We don't have any form for crud operations on this table and it get feed direct from Sql Server Management Studio)

> *PersonPersonality* is the table that keep the data that each person has how many type of personalities.

we want to create these tables by entity framework code first and also we need a model per table to use in our project so we create a class per table just like this picture:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30793006/182153818-9278e716-1f06-4bee-a85c-194a7000891a.png)

as we don't have any base table for *gender* and *status* in *Person* table so we create two enums for these fileds.

## Connect to Database
Now we want to connect to database. the *DAL* Layer should be responsible for this one.
before start we should install necessory packages. install these packages on DAL Project:
> Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore

> Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design

> Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

> Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

> as you know the database context get the connectin string from the end layer. in this project our context get the database connection string from *Api* layer. so we need to define database connection string in the file *appsettings.json* in *Api* layer. like this:
  `"ConnectionStrings": {
    "RegisterationFormDbContext": "Server=.;Database=RegisterationForm;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }`

> now we should connect our context to databse. for this one we should do it in the layer that injects the services(here, IoC layer). for this you need install the package *Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions* then we create a class with name DbConfig and use the ef core service to connect our database context to database. like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30793006/182185009-37b606e0-adfe-43fe-8a95-f8696e17bc46.png)


> at the next step you should inject this config in the end layer with the path: *Api/Proram.cs* like this:

`builder.Services.AddDatabaseConfig(configuration);`

> now we need create database and tables by ef. before use migration you should install *Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design* on Api layer because it's needed.

> now you can go to *Package Manager Console* and write the first add migration code like this: *Add-Migrations InitializeDb*

> Congratulations your project is connected to database.

## Implement UnitOfWork
We use UnitOfWork pattern to work with data such as (get, write, update or delete) so since the UnitOfWork has 2 parts, the first part is *Interface* and the second part is *Implementation* we put the *Interface* in Infrastructure layer and implement them in the DAL layer.

> In the layer *Infrastructure* create a folder with name *IUnitOfWork* then create 2 interfaces one with name IGenericRepository and the other with name IUnitOfWork

> In IGenericRepository you should define all crud methods that you want use in project such as (getById, getAll, Insert, ...) and this class is generic type of *T* that *T* is the name of our table. it means that the *IGenericRepository* can be polymorphism of any model and your methods can operate for any table of database.

> In IUnitOfWork you
